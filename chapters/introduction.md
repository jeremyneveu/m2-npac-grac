# Introduction


Cosmology is the study of the evolution of the Universe on large scales. Here, large means on scales much larger than the typical distances between galaxies, that is tens of Mpc. But why would such a science even be needed? When did it become clear that observations do not agree with an infinite, homogeneous and stationary Universe? Both from the observational and the theoretical point of view, one can say that cosmology was born in the beginning of the $20^{\mathrm{th}}$ century. But interestingly, unanswered questions (whose answers lie in modern cosmology) appeared much earlier than that.

## Olbers' paradox

Olbers' paradox can be stated quite simply: "Why is the night sky dark?". The question is actually much older than Olbers formulation (1823). Kepler (for example) was wondering the same thing as early as 1610. The paradox arises when considering a homogeneous stationary and infinite universe. Then the content of the universe can be described with a constant number density $n$ of sources of light of luminosity $L$. The flux received by an observer from a source of light located at a distance $r$ is then ${L \over 4 \pi r^2}$. Summing over all sources, the total flux is:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:olbers}
F=\int_0^\infty {n\,L \over 4 \pi r^2} 4 \pi r^2 dr = + \infty.
\end{equation}


Allowing for the fact that stars are not point-like and can screen other stars further along the line of sight, we get a night sky that should be as bright as the typical surface of a star. Neither Kepler nor Olbers gave a satisfactory answer to the paradox. Kepler assumed that there were no
stars beyond a certain distance, which conflicts with homogeneity but was reasonable at the time, and Olbers assumed that light was absorbed along the way by interstellar gas, which would induce an increase in the temperature of the gas and break
the assumption that the Universe is stationary. The point is that Olbers paradox cannot be resolved in a homogeneous, stationary and infinite universe. Modern cosmology solves it by
getting rid of stationary Universe assumption. Let's also mention that until only 20 years ago another solution was to postulate a universe 
with a fractal content (thus getting rid of homogeneity without introducing a center). While this is compatible with observations up to scales of a few tens of Mpc, recent galaxy surveys show that homogeneity is reached on $> 100$ Mpc scales.

## Hubble-Lemaître law

First Lemaître in 1926, in a little known paper written in French, then Edwin Hubble in 1929, found a correlation between the distance of nearby galaxies and their radial velocities. The distances were estimated using Cepheid stars when the image resolution was good enough that individual star could be identified. Indeed,
Cepheid stars have an average intrinsic luminosity that can be measured from the period of its fluctuation. Measuring the received flux then yields the distance (assuming negligible absorption along the line of sight). In other cases, much more approximate estimators of the distance were used. Although no reference is given in the original paper, the radial velocities were most likely obtained through measurements of the Doppler shift of spectral lines by V. M. Slipher. Lemaître and Hubble's insight was to recognize that the receding velocities (corrected from the Sun's own velocity) were proportional to the distance of the galaxies:

$$ v=H_0 d $$

$H_0$ is called the Hubble constant. Hubble's original estimation of $H_0$ was wildly wrong (more than $7$ times the current value), mainly because of the strongly underestimated distances of the most distant galaxies in his sample. Nevertheless, this was the first observational hint that the universe as a whole is expanding  homogeneously. Modern cosmology still probes this relation, using different but equivalent quantities, applied to the case type Ia supernovae whose distances can be
accurately computed (they have a well known peak luminosity). The original and modern versions of the velocity-distance relation are shown in fig. \ref{hubble}.

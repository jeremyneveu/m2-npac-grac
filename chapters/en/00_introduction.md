Special Relativity Review
-------------------------

### Principle of Special Relativity

At the end of the 19th century, Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism established itself as the description of electrical and magnetic phenomena. Better yet, it predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves which were discovered in 1888 by Heinrich Hertz. Their study showed that they have all the known properties of light waves (reflection and refraction, interference, polarization and diffraction) and especially the same speed $c = 1/\sqrt{\epsilon_0\mu_0}$ which emerges from Maxwell's equations. Hertzian and light waves are therefore electromagnetic waves, but Maxwell's electromagnetism says nothing about the reference frame in which this speed would be defined. Furthermore, the Michelson and Morley experiment (1887) <wiki:Michelson–Morley_experiment> shows that the speed of light does not seem to compose with the Earth's velocity around the Sun, while Fizeau's experiment (1849) <wiki:Fizeau_experiment> shows that it partially composes with that of a moving fluid. We therefore understand that electromagnetic theory is poorly aligned with Newtonian mechanics and seems to need patching up according to contradictory experimental results.

Rather than undertaking this hazardous path which would have caused the theory to lose its predictive power when bodies are in motion, Albert Einstein proposes a revolutionary approach in his famous 1905 article *On the electrodynamics of moving bodies* {cite:p}`Einstein1905`. He postulates that the speed of light is the same in every reference frame and thus calls into question the Galilean composition of velocities, and even the notions of space and time. The fundamental principle of this new physics is the principle of special relativity.

:::{important} Principle of Special Relativity

The laws of physics are identical in all Galilean reference frames.
:::

If a physical law appears to be true in an inertial reference frame, within the experimental uncertainties defining its domain of validity, then it must remain true in another Galilean reference frame. This is the case, for example, with Newton's fundamental principle of dynamics. However, imposing this on electromagnetic theory poses a serious problem, as it requires calling into question the Galilean composition of velocities for electromagnetic waves.

### Lorentz Transformations

*If electromagnetic theory is verified in a Galilean reference frame, what are the spatio-temporal coordinate transformations that can leave this speed invariant?*
Consider two events with spatio-temporal coordinates $(t_1,x_1,y_1,z_1)$ and $(t_2, x_2, y_2, z_2)$ in a reference frame $\mathcal{R}$ linked by the exchange of a light signal, then:
$$ c^2(t_2-t_1)^2 = (x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2 + (z_2-z_1)^2 $$
Imposing the constancy of velocity implies that in another Galilean reference frame $\mathcal{R}'$ we also verify:
$$ c^2(t'_2-t'_1)^2 = (x'_2-x'_1)^2 + (y'_2-y'_1)^2 + (z'_2-z'_1)^2 $$
It therefore appears judicious to define the spacetime interval for an interval between two infinitely close events:
$$ \dd s^2 = -c^2 \dd t^2 + \dd x^2 + \dd y^2 + \dd z^2 $$

Consider a four-vector of coordinates $x^\alpha$, where component $\alpha=0$ corresponds to time[^2] $ct$ (with $c$ the famous maximum speed and $t$ the time) and components $\alpha=1,2,3$ correspond to Cartesian coordinates $x,y,z$. In this course, we will use Greek letters for components ranging from 0 to 3 and Latin letters for spatial components ranging from 1 to 3. We define the Minkowski metric:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:minkowski}
\eta_{\alpha\beta} = \begin{pmatrix}
-1 & 0& 0& 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 &0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
such that in Cartesian coordinates we can define the spacetime interval between two close spatio-temporal coordinates:
$$ \dd s^2 = - c^2 \dd t^2 + \dd \vec x^2 = \eta_{\alpha\beta}\dd x^\alpha \dd x^\beta $$

To switch to another coordinate system $x'^\alpha$, we introduce the Lorentz transformation $\Lambda^\alpha_{\;\beta}$ as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:boost}
x'^{\alpha} = \Lambda^\alpha_{\;\beta} x^\beta + a^\alpha,
\end{equation}
where $a^\alpha$ is a simple temporal and spatial translation.

What form should this transformation take? To ensure that the speed of light is invariant under coordinate system changes $x'^{\alpha}$, we must preserve $\vert \dd \vec x' / \dd t'\vert = c$ for the propagation of a light ray, hence $\dd s'^2=\dd s^2 = 0$. The Lorentz transformation must therefore ensure conservation of the spacetime interval:
$$
\dd s'^2 =  \eta_{\alpha\beta}\dd x'^\alpha \dd x'^\beta = \eta_{\alpha\beta} \Lambda^{\alpha}_{\;\gamma} \Lambda^{\beta}_{\;\delta}  \dd x'^\gamma \dd x'^\delta = \eta_{\gamma\delta} \dd x^\gamma \dd x^\beta = \dd s^2
$$
Hence the closure relation:
$$
\label{eq:dscons}
\eta_{\alpha\beta} \Lambda^{\alpha}_{\;\gamma} \Lambda^{\beta}_{\;\delta} =  \eta_{\gamma\delta}
$$

From the constitutive relation [](#eq:dscons), we can demonstrate that Lorentz transformations form a group defined by $\Lambda^{0}_{\;0}\geqslant 1$ and $\mathrm{det}\;\Lambda=+1$. A few calculations later (see {cite:t}`raimond` or {cite:t}`langlois2013RG` for example), we show that the coordinate transformation between two reference frames where one moves at velocity $\vec v = v \vec e_{1}$ is uniquely written as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lorentz}
\Lambda^{\alpha}_{\;\beta} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\gamma & -\beta \gamma & 0 & 0 \\
-\beta \gamma & \gamma & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 &0 & 1 
\end{pmatrix},
\quad \beta = \frac{v}{c},\quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}
\end{equation}
to guarantee the constancy of the speed of light in all Galilean reference frames.

If we include spatial rotations, with a reference frame moving at constant velocity $\vec v$ relative to another reference frame, the components of tensor $\Lambda^\alpha_{\;\beta}$ are finally written as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lorentz2}
\Lambda^0_{\;0} = \gamma,\quad \Lambda^i_{\;0} = -\gamma v_i / c,\quad \Lambda^0_{\;j} = -\gamma v_j / c,\quad \Lambda^i_{\;j} = \delta_{ij} +  (\gamma - 1)  \frac{v_i v_j}{v^2}
\end{equation}

:::{note} Link between light and relativity
Why should the speed of light specifically be invariant? What is the link between light and a new formulation of mechanics? Since light is carried by the photon, a massless particle, this is also the maximum velocity that can be reached in our Universe. If electromagnetic theory had not been written in 1905, an argument could also have been that there must exist a maximum velocity in the Universe if we think that no information transport can be instantaneous. At that point, the principle of relativity imposes that this limiting velocity must be the same in all inertial reference frames and the pivotal speed of Special Relativity theory would have been the velocity of the fastest-propagating interaction. Which in our Universe turns out to be the electromagnetic interaction {cite:p}`landau1989theory`. In both approaches, the Principle of Special Relativity imposes that there exists a maximum velocity $c$ invariant under coordinate system changes.
:::

Lorentz transformations impose that not only does the speed of light not compose with the velocity of an observer or source, but also that it is unsurpassable. However, gravitational force propagates instantaneously over infinite distance in Newtonian theory. The displacement of a mass is instantly felt gravitationally throughout the Universe. After having to rewrite the equations of kinematics to preserve Maxwell's equations, Einstein worked for the following 10 years to reformulate Newtonian gravitational theory so that it would fit into this new framework. The main ingredient of his approach is the observation that gravitational mass and inertial mass are identical, which is an indication that gravitation could be described by a kinematic effect.

From Newton to General Relativity
----------------------------------

General Relativity is the theory of gravitation at the basis of modern cosmology. It provides a geometric explanation for the gravitational force introduced by Newton three centuries earlier. In this theory, falling to the ground is no longer due to a force vector unfortunately oriented towards the soil, but to the deformation of spacetime caused by the Earth. Formulated this way, General Relativity seems quite complicated for little gain. But the general principles at the base of this theory and the richness of its implications (including Newtonian theory) make it the flagship theory for describing gravitation. Throughout this section, we will introduce step by step several concepts of General Relativity such as the geodesic equation, the metric and the covariant derivative, to arrive at Einstein's equation of General Relativity, the basis of modern cosmology. This introduction is largely inspired by {cite:t}`Weinberg1972` and {cite:t}`Gourgoulhon2013`. 

### The Equivalence Principle

In Newton's fundamental principle of dynamics, why is the mass involved in the inertia term strictly the same as that involved in Newtonian gravitation? This troubling equality between inertial mass and gravitational mass, validated by centuries of experimentation (Newton's pendulums, Eötvös' balance, etc.), sets gravitation apart from other interactions, such as Coulomb's force, which depends on the electrical charge of the bodies considered. This suggests that gravitation is not a property of the bodies themselves, but of the space in which they move. 

Let's consider a point mass of mass $m$ subjected to a uniform and constant external gravitational field $\vec g$ and to no other force. Then the fundamental principle of dynamics applied in a Galilean reference frame to this object allows us to predict its position $\vec x$ at an instant $t$ by solving the differential equation:
$$m\frac{\dd^2\vec x}{\dd t^2} = m\vec g$$ 
Let's place ourselves in the object's (non-galilean) frame of reference using the following coordinate transformation:
$$
\vec x' = \vec x - \frac{1}{2}\vec g t^2, \qquad t'=t$$ 
Then in this frame of reference the gravitational force is “absorbed” by the inertial term:
$$m\frac{\dd^2\vec x}{\dd t^2} = m\vec g \Leftrightarrow m\frac{\dd ^2\vec x'}{\dd t'^2} = 0.$$
The laws of physics therefore appear identical for an observer bound to a Galilean reference frame considering that the object is subject to a gravitational force and for an observer bound to a uniformly accelerated reference frame considering that the object is not subject to a gravitational force. The gravitational force felt by a point mass is therefore equivalent to the choice of a uniformly accelerated reference frame relative to a Galilean reference frame, at least locally in a region where $\vec g$ is quasi-constant and for an experiment duration where $\vec g$ is quasi-stationary. The Equivalence Principle formulated by Einstein acknowledges the equivalence between gravitation and acceleration due to the equality of inertial and gravitational masses, at least for gravitational fields that vary weakly in time and space.

:::{important} The Equivalence Principle

*At each point of spacetime in an arbitrary gravitational field it is possible to choose a local particular system of inertial coordinates such that, in a sufficiently small region around the point in question, all laws of nature take the same form as in a non-accelerated Cartesian coordinate system without gravitation* {cite:p}`Weinberg1972`. 
:::

This is therefore a generalization of the principle of special relativity to all reference frames, in the presence of gravitation or not. This principle is verified experimentally with very good precision, notably by *Lunar Laser Ranging* {cite:p}`Williams2004`.

### Equations of motion

Let us apply the Equivalence Principle to the problem of a massive object in free fall. For this object, there therefore exists locally a *particular* coordinate system such that the equation of its trajectory $x'^\mu$ can be written in the same way as if the reference frame were non-accelerated and without gravitation:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eqm1}
\frac{\dd^2 x'^\mu}{\dd\tau^2}=0,
\end{equation}
with $\dd\tau$ the proper time[^1]:
$$
\label{eq:proper-time}
\dd \tau^2 \equiv -\eta_{\mu\nu} \dd x'^\mu \dd x'^\nu.
$$ 
The parameter $\tau$ will allow us to parameterize the curve $x'^\mu(\tau)$, like a curvilinear abscissa. In this equation it only plays the role of a label to parameterize the successive positions of the object, but it has the immense advantage of being Lorentz invariant and of being the time measured by the observer in the particle's reference frame.

According to the Equivalence Principle, this equation is also valid in a certain neighborhood of the object in question with another choice of spatio-temporal coordinates. There therefore exists another arbitrary coordinate system in which we have the right to rewrite the equation of its trajectory $x^\mu$. Let us look for the form it would take for these coordinates $x^\mu$:
$$
0=\frac{\dd^2 x'^\mu}{\dd\tau^2}=\frac{\dd}{\dd\tau}\left(\frac{\partial x'^\mu}{\partial x^\nu} \frac{\dd x^\nu}{\dd\tau}\right) = \frac{\partial x'^\mu}{\partial x^\nu} \frac{\dd^2 x^\nu}{\dd\tau^2} + \frac{\partial^2 x'^\mu}{\partial x^\nu \partial x^\rho}\frac{\dd x^\nu}{\dd\tau}\frac{\dd x^\rho}{\dd\tau}.$$
After multiplication by $\partial x^\gamma/\partial x'^\mu$, we obtain[^inv] the new equation of motion:
$$
\label{eq:eqm2}
\frac{\dd^2x^\nu}{\dd\tau^2} + \Gamma^\nu_{\ \mu\rho}\frac{\dd x^\mu}{\dd\tau}\frac{\dd x^\rho}{\dd\tau}=0,
$$
where $\Gamma^\nu_{\ \mu\rho}$ is the *affine connection* defined by:
$$
\Gamma^\nu_{\ \mu\rho} \equiv \frac{\partial x^\nu}{\partial x'^\lambda}\frac{\partial^2 x'^\lambda}{\partial x^\mu \partial x^\rho}.$$
The proper time is rewritten:
$$
\dd \tau^2=-\eta_{\mu\nu} \dd x'^\mu \dd x'^\nu = -g_{\mu\nu} \dd x^\mu \dd x^\nu
$$
which thus defines the metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$:
$$
\boxed{g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\alpha\beta} \frac{\partial x'^\alpha}{\partial x^\mu} \frac{\partial x'^\beta}{\partial x^\nu}}
$$
The tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$ describes the geometry of spacetime in the new coordinate system $x^\mu$ and replaces the Cartesian metric $\eta_{\mu\nu}$. This is the fundamental object of General Relativity because it allows describing distances traveled in a non-Euclidean (curved) spacetime.


:::{tip} The metric tensor in simple cases

* Consider a 2D Euclidean space with metric $\eta_{\alpha\beta} = \text{diag}(1, 1)$ with coordinates $\vec X=(x,y)$. We perform a rotation of space by angle $\theta$, going to coordinates $\vec X'=(x',y')$ by:
\begin{equation*}
\left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
x' &= x\cos \theta + y \sin \theta \\
y' &= y\cos \theta - x \sin\theta
\end{array}
\right. \Rightarrow g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\alpha\beta} \frac{\partial X'^\alpha}{\partial X^\mu} \frac{\partial X'^\beta}{\partial X^\nu}
\end{equation*}
Let us calculate $g_{11}$ for the example:
\begin{equation*}
g_{11} = \eta_{\alpha\beta} \frac{\partial X'^\alpha}{\partial X^1} \frac{\partial X'^\beta}{\partial X^1} = \left(\frac{\partial x'}{\partial x}\right)^2 +  \left(\frac{\partial y'}{\partial x}\right)^2 = \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1
\end{equation*}
After calculating the other terms, we have:
\begin{equation*}
g_{\mu\nu} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0& 1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}
so the space remains Euclidean after rotation. Equivalently we could have obtained the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ by studying the conservation of a length element by rotation:
\begin{equation*}
\dd \vec l^2 = \dd x^2 + \dd y^2 = \cdots = (\dd x')^2 + (\dd y')^2.
\end{equation*}

* Consider a 2D spherical space of radius $a$. A position on the sphere is given by two angles $\vec \xi = (\theta, \phi)$. An elementary vector $\dd \vec l$ on the sphere has length:
\begin{equation*}
\dd \vec l^2 = a^2\dd \theta^2 + a^2 \sin^2 \theta \dd \phi^2 = g_{ij} \dd \xi^i \dd \xi^j
\end{equation*}

```{figure} ../../images/sphere_gmunu


```

Hence the metric on this curved space:
\begin{equation*}
g_{\mu\nu} = \begin{pmatrix}
a^2 & 0 \\
0& a^2\sin^2\theta
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*} 
Hence the metric on this curved space:
\begin{equation*}
g_{\mu\nu} = \begin{pmatrix}
a^2 & 0 \\
0& a^2\sin^2\theta
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*} 
whose curvature is half the Ricci scalar (see <wiki:Scalar_curvature>) and equals $1/a^2 > 0$ as expected for a sphere.

* Consider a 2D Euclidean spacetime with metric $\eta_{\alpha\beta} = \text{diag}(1, 1, 1)$ with coordinates $\vec X=(ct, x,y)$. We perform a Galilean translation of space by a constant velocity $\vec V=V\vec e_x$, going to coordinates $\vec X'=(ct', x',y')$ by:
\begin{equation*}
\left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
ct' & = ct \\
x' &= x + Vt \\
y' &= y
\end{array}
\right. 
\Rightarrow g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\alpha\beta} \frac{\partial X'^\alpha}{\partial X^\mu} \frac{\partial X'^\beta}{\partial X^\nu} \approx 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & V/c & 0 \\
V/c & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}



:::




:::{note} Inverse metric
:class: dropdown

The inverse metric tensor is defined by:
$$
g^{\mu\nu} = \eta^{\alpha\beta} \frac{\partial x^\mu}{\partial x'^\alpha} \frac{\partial x^\nu}{\partial x'^\beta}.$$
Indeed, by definition we have: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
g^{\nu\rho}g_{\mu\nu} & = \eta^{\alpha\beta} \frac{\partial x^\nu}{\partial x'^\alpha} \frac{\partial x^\rho }{\partial x'^\beta} 
\eta_{\gamma\delta} \frac{\partial x'^\gamma}{\partial x^\mu} \frac{\partial x'^\delta}{\partial x^\nu} \\
& = \delta^\delta_\alpha  \eta^{\alpha\beta} \frac{\partial x^\rho }{\partial x'^\beta} \eta_{\gamma\delta} 
\frac{\partial x'^\gamma}{\partial x^\mu}
\text{ with } \frac{\partial x^\nu}{\partial x'^\alpha}\frac{\partial x'^\delta}{\partial x^\nu} = \delta^\delta_\alpha \\
& = \frac{\partial x^\rho}{\partial x'^\beta}\frac{\partial x'^\beta}{\partial x^\mu} 
= \delta^\rho_\mu,\end{aligned}$$
where $\delta^\rho_\mu$ is the Kronecker symbol ($\delta^\rho_\mu=1$ if $\rho=\mu$, 0 otherwise). 
:::

We could subsequently show that $\Gamma^\nu_{\ \mu\rho}$ can only be written using a single coordinate system and the metric tensor:
$$
\label{eq:connexion}
\Gamma^\nu_{\ \mu\rho} = \frac{1}{2}g^{\lambda\nu}\left( \frac{\partial g_{\lambda\rho}}{\partial x^\mu} + \frac{\partial g_{\mu\lambda}}{\partial x^\rho}  - \frac{\partial g_{\mu\rho}}{\partial x^\lambda} \right)
$$

For a massless particle, like the photon or neutrino, the proper time defined by equation [](#eq:proper-time) is zero. Instead of $\tau$ we can then use another curvilinear abscissa, such as coordinate $\lambda = x^0$ to parameterize the trajectory of the curve. By similar reasoning we arrive at this equation of motion:
$$
\label{eq:eqm3}
\frac{\dd^2x^\nu}{\dd \lambda^2} + \Gamma^\nu_{\ \mu\rho}\frac{\dd x^\mu}{\dd \lambda}\frac{\dd x^\rho}{\dd \lambda}=0.
$$
If present, forces other than gravitation applying to the test particle can be added to the right-hand side of equation [](#eq:eqm3):
$$\label{eq:eqm4}
\boxed{\frac{\dd^2x^\nu}{\dd \lambda^2} + \Gamma^\nu_{\ \mu\rho}\frac{\dd x^\mu}{\dd \lambda}\frac{\dd x^\rho}{\dd \lambda}=\frac{f^\mu}{m}}
$$
with $m$ the mass of the object and $f^\mu$ the contravariant vector of non-gravitational forces applying to a massive particle[^2prime]. The correct writing of the fundamental principle of dynamics according to the Equivalence Principle is therefore equation [](#eq:eqm4), because it can be shown that the latter is indeed invariant under a local coordinate system transformation (demonstration {cite:t}`Weinberg1972`[p. 102]). 

### Covariant derivative

The affine connection $\Gamma^\nu_{\ \mu\rho}$ also intervenes in the definition of the covariant derivative $V^\nu{}_{;\mu}$ of a vector $V^\nu$ with respect to coordinate $x'^\mu$:
$$
V^\nu{}_{;\mu} \equiv \partial_\mu V^\nu + \Gamma^\nu_{\ \mu\rho}V^\rho.
$$
The first term corresponds to the ordinary variation of a vector if we move it in its neighborhood. The second term takes into account the changes of the coordinate system also moved, because the Christoffel symbol describes the changes of the reference frame's basis vectors.

:::{figure} ../../images/covariant_derivative.svg

Illustration of the variation of a vector $V^\mu$ (cyan) in the neighborhood of a basis $(e_\mu, e_\nu)$ of a curved space. Following a displacement in its neighborhood (here along $e_\mu$), the vector changes size (first term of the covariant derivative) and the basis that defines its projections and hence these coordinates also changes. The covariant derivative calculates the variation of the components of vector $V^\mu$ due to these two changes.
::: 

This definition of the derivative in General Relativity correctly expresses the variation of a vector along a coordinate in a curved space. This variation vector transforms in the same way as a contravariant vector by a coordinate change (unlike the usual derivative): the variation vector $V^\nu{}_{;\mu}$ is therefore correctly defined for any coordinate system.

To illustrate all its depth, here is the definition of the covariant derivative $DV^\mu/D\tau$ not with respect to a coordinate, but along any curve parameterized by proper time $\tau$ (invariant under coordinate changes):
$$
\frac{DV^\mu}{D\tau} \equiv \frac{\dd V^\mu}{\dd\tau} + \Gamma^\mu_{\ \nu\lambda}\frac{\dd x^\lambda}{\dd\tau} V^\nu.$$
Let $U^\mu$ be the velocity vector $\dd x^\mu/\dd\tau$. The equation of motion [](#eq:eqm4) is then written very simply as
$$
\boxed{m\frac{DU^\mu}{D\tau}=f^\mu}
$$ 
This equation thus written strongly recalls the fundamental principle of dynamics, but places mechanics in a relativistic framework invariant under any coordinate system change. The notion of covariant derivative is therefore well suited to General Relativity calculations and properly replaces the usual derivative in this framework.

In general, replacing the usual derivatives of a physical theory by covariant derivatives allows arriving at a writing of physical laws respecting the equivalence principle, hence an invariance under reference frame changes and in the presence of gravitation. If this is true without gravitation and locally in Minkowski space, then it remains true in any reference frame with gravitation. For example, in the absence of gravitational field Maxwell's equations are written:
$$
\frac{\partial F^{\alpha\beta}}{\partial x^\alpha} = - J^\beta
$$
where $J^\beta$ is the electric current four-vector and $F^{\alpha\beta}$ the electromagnetic tensor. If we introduce tensors $F^{\mu\nu}$ and $J^\mu$ such that the latter reduce to $F^{\alpha\beta}$ and $J^\beta$ in an inertial Minkowski reference frame, then electromagnetic theory respects the equivalence principle if we use the covariant derivative:
$$
F^{\mu\nu}{}_{;\mu} = - J^\mu
$$
and this writing is valid in any coordinate system since it is true in Minkowski.

:::{note} Covariant derivative of a covariant vector

Note that for a covariant vector, the covariant derivative is written:
$$\label{eq:dcov-cov}
\frac{DV_\mu}{D\tau} \equiv \frac{\dd V_\mu}{\dd\tau} - \Gamma^\nu_{\ \mu\lambda}\frac{\dd x^\lambda}{\dd\tau} V_\nu.
$$
:::


### Towards Einstein's equation

Armed with these tools, let us now go towards a simple derivation of Einstein's equation which summarizes gravitation as a deformation of spacetime by matter. Let us start by considering a massive particle moving slowly in a weak gravitational field, constant but arbitrary this time. According to the Equivalence Principle, we have seen that there exists an inertial coordinate system $\left(ct',\vec x'\right)$ such that equation of motion [](#eq:eqm1) is still valid in another reference frame $\left(ct,\vec x\right)$ but with gravitational field. The hypothesis of slow velocity allows us to neglect $\dd\vec x/\dd\tau$ compared to $c\dd t/\dd\tau$. We then have to first order in a weak and quasi-stationary gravitational field:
$$
\frac{\dd^2x^\mu}{\dd\tau^2} + \Gamma^\mu_{\ 00}\left(c\frac{\dd t}{\dd\tau}\right)^2=0, \qquad \Gamma^\mu_{\;\; 00} \approx -\frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\nu}\frac{\partial g_{00}}{\partial x^\nu}.
$$

In the hypothesis of a weak gravitational field, we can adopt an almost Cartesian metric:
$$
g_{\mu\nu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}+h_{\mu\nu},\qquad \vert h_{\mu\nu} \vert \ll 1,
$$
and we obtain to first order: 
$$
\left\lbrace
\begin{array}{rl}
    \mu=1,2,3\ : & \displaystyle{\frac{\dd^2\vec x}{\dd\tau^2} = \frac{1}{2}\left(c\frac{\dd t}{\dd\tau}\right)^2\vec{\nabla} h_{00} } \\
    \mu=0\ : & \displaystyle{\frac{\dd^2 t}{\dd\tau^2} = 0.}
\end{array}
\right.
$$ 
From the second equation we deduce that $\dd t/\dd\tau$ is a constant. So we can divide the first equation by $\dd t / \dd \tau$ and we obtain:
$$
\label{eq:vers_einstein}
\frac{\dd^2\vec x}{\dd t^2} = \frac{1}{2}c^2\vec{\nabla} h_{00}.
$$ 
But we know that in the Newtonian limit we have:
$$
\frac{\dd^2\vec x}{\dd t^2} = -\vec{\nabla} \phi$$
with $\phi$ the gravitational potential (i.e., $\phi=-\GN M /r$ if it is generated by a mass $M$ at distance $r$, $\GN$ being Newton's constant). Comparing with [](#eq:vers_einstein), we have $h_{00}=-2\phi/c^2+\text{constant}$. But the metric must be Minkowski at infinity (weak perturbation hypothesis), so $h_{00}=-2\phi/c^2$ and:
$$
\label{eq:g00}
g_{00}=-\left(1+\frac{2\phi}{c^2}\right),
$$ 
Consequently, the spacetime metric will be able to contain gravitational effects. Element $g_{00}$ corresponding to the temporal component of the metric, the beating of clocks therefore depends on the intensity of the gravitational field. This corresponds to the Einstein effect, the only consequence of General Relativity used technologically today (in GPS, see [](#fig:effet_einstein)).


:::{figure} ../../images/effet_eintein.svg

Illustration of the Einstein effect. A photon falling into a gravitational well gains energy so its frequency increases. Equivalently, we can say that clocks in a gravitational field lag behind identical clocks located outside. GPS receivers must take this effect into account to deduce their position relative to satellites.
:::

This exercise on a point particle teaches us that the gravitational field is finally contained in the metric, and that this metric therefore depends on the presence of matter. It is therefore possible to imagine a generalization of this observation. The Newtonian potential is determined by Poisson's equation:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:poisson}
\nabla^2\phi = 4\pi \GN \rho_m
\end{equation}
where $\rho_m$ is the mass density and $\GN$ Newton's constant. The latter is associated with the energy density $\epsilon$ of the matter energy-momentum tensor $T_{00} = \epsilon = \rho_m c^2 $ (see chapter [](./02_friedmann_equations.md)), so with equation [](#eq:g00) we can obtain:
$$
\nabla^2 g_{00}=-\frac{8\pi \GN}{c^4} T_{00}.
$$ 
This equation is not invariant under Lorentz transformation, hence the necessity to modify Newtonian gravitation theory if we admit the principle of special relativity. Tensors are the good objects that can allow achieving this objective. We can then imagine that there exists a tensor $G_{\mu\nu}$ combining first and second derivatives of the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ generalizing this last equation to all coordinates such that 
$$
\label{eq:einstein1}
G_{\mu\nu}=-\frac{8\pi \GN}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}.
$$ 
This last equation corresponds to a first version of *Einstein's equation*. This reasoning only allowed us to intuit its form, but another more rigorous demonstration allows obtaining the expression of the Einstein tensor $G_{\mu\nu}$: 
$$

with $R_{\mu\nu}$ the Ricci tensor and $R$ the scalar curvature (trace of the Ricci tensor $R^\mu_{\;\mu}$), themselves obtained by the Riemann tensor $R^\mu_{\ \nu\alpha\beta}$: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
R^\mu_{\ \nu\alpha\beta} & = -\partial_\alpha \Gamma^\mu_{\ \nu\beta} +  \partial_\beta \Gamma^\mu_{\ \nu\alpha} - \Gamma^\mu_{\ \alpha\sigma}\Gamma^\sigma_{\ \nu\beta} + \Gamma^\mu_{\ \beta\sigma}\Gamma^\sigma_{\ \nu\alpha} \\
R_{\mu\nu} & =R^\alpha_{\ \mu\alpha\nu}.
\end{aligned}
$$
*Since the Einstein tensor $G_{\mu\nu}$ contains second derivatives of the metric, Einstein's equation links the curvature of spacetime and hence the trajectories of bodies to its energy and matter content.*


Moreover, $G_{\mu\nu}$ appears to have zero divergence. This is Bianchi's identity:
$$G^{\mu\nu}_{\;\;\;;\mu}=0.$$

:::{important} Conservation of $T^{\mu\nu}$

Bianchi's identity and Einstein's equation [](#eq:einstein1) imposes energy conservation, therefore directly derived from geometric properties:
$$
\label{eq:conservation_energie_tenseur}
T^{\mu\nu}_{\;\;\;;\mu}=0
$$
:::

By Bianchi's identity, we also see that Einstein's equation can be defined up to a constant[^3] while keeping energy conservation. This constant is now called the cosmological constant. Here is Einstein's equation in its final form {cite:p}`Einstein1917`:
$$\label{eq:einstein2}
\boxed{G_{\mu\nu}-\Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = -\frac{8\pi \GN}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}}
$$


[^1]: Through this definition, we have chosen a metric of signature $(-,+,+,+)$ which we will keep hereafter.

[^2]: Hereafter, index $0$ of tensors will therefore correspond to the temporal coordinate, while the following indices will correspond to spatial coordinates.

[^inv]: Knowing that $\frac{\partial x'^\rho}{\partial x^\mu} \frac{\partial x^\mu}{\partial x'^\nu} = \delta^\rho_\nu$, because $\frac{\partial x'^\rho}{\partial x^\mu}$ is the Jacobian of the coordinate transformation $x^\mu \to x'^\nu $ and the second factor is its inverse.

[^2prime]: If studying a massless particle, it suffices to replace $f^\mu/m$ by the model of the interaction applying to this particle.

[^3]: Because we also have $g^{\mu\nu}{}_{;\mu}=0$.

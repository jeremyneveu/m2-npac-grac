Broad-band cosmic-ray observations
----------------------------------

### Spectrum and composition

The local cosmic-ray spectrum. From this [page](https://zenodo.org/records/7948212).

:::{figure}  ../images/CR_observables_2020PhR...872....1B.png
:name: fig:cr_observables
:align: center
:width: 60%

Simplified view of the cosmic-ray observables. The local cosmic-ray spectrum is scaled to a power $E^{2.7}$ in panel (a) to enhance the features. The mean logarithmic of cosmic-rays is shown in panel (b). Note that $\ln A_\mathrm{H} = 0$, $\ln A_\mathrm{C} \approx 2.5$ and $\ln A_\mathrm{Fe} \approx 4$. The dipole amplitude and right-ascension are displayed in panels (c) and (d), which also includes the right ascension of the Galactic Center. Adapted from {cite}`2020PhR...872....1B`.

Candidate sources for cosmic-ray production
----------------------------------

### Maximum energy

#### The Hillas criterion

:::{figure}  ../images/CR_Hillas.pdf
:name: fig:cr_hillas
:align: center
:width: 60%

Magnetic field in Gauss vs size in km of candidate cosmic-ray sources. The Hillas limit, which provides the minimum magnetic field at a fixed size needed to accelerate cosmic rays to a given magnetic rigidity, is shown in blue for protons at the knee energy and in brown for protons at the ankle energy.

Overview of gamma-ray and (possibly) neutrino sources
----------------------------------

### The TeV-PeV neutrino sky



:::{figure}  ../images/icecube_ngc1068_2022Sci...378..538I.png
:name: fig:neutrino_north_sky
:align: center
:width: 100%

Neutrino significance map at energies above 1 TeV in equatorial coordinates. An excess in the direction of the non-jetted active and star-forming galaxy NGC 1068 is preferred at $4.2\,\sigma$ level with respect to a background-only hypothesis. The other circled sources do not provide (yet?) evidence of excess. From {cite}`2022Sci...378..538I`.
:::

:::{figure}  ../images/skymap_nsigma_2023Sci...380.1338I.pdf
:name: fig:neutrino_sky_map
:align: center
:width: 100%

Neutrino significance map at energies above 0.5 TeV in equatorial coordinates. The Galactic plane and center are shown as a solid gray line and a gray circle, respectively. From {cite}`2023Sci...380.1338I`.
:::

:::{figure}  ../images/neutrino_gp_2023Sci...380.1338I.pdf
:name: fig:neutrino_gp
:align: center
:width: 100%

Neutrino significance map at energies above 0.5 TeV along the Galactic plane (bottom panel), compared to the expected flux from charged pion decay, to the photon flux expected from neutral pion decay and observed above 1 GeV. The top panel also shows an optical view of the Galactic plane. The model inferred from pion decay favors an excess in the Galactic plane at the $4.5\,\sigma$ level with respect to a background-only hypothesis. From {cite}`2023Sci...380.1338I`.

### The GeV-TeV gamma-ray sky


:::{figure}  ../images/gamma_ray_sky.png
:name: fig:gama_ray_sky
:align: center
:width: 100%

Gamma-ray excess maps above 10 GeV (top panel), 1 TeV (middle panel) and 100 TeV (bottom panel) in Galactic coordinates. From Z. Cao's presentation at [TAUP2023](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1199289/contributions/5263064/attachments/2706141/4699253/G-astronomy-TAUP2023.pdf).

### A future window: the MeV sky

:::{figure}  ../images/MeVGap.pdf
:name: fig:MeV_gap
:align: center
:width: 100%

Sensitivity of current X-ray and gamma-ray instruments, i.e. minimum flux detectable ($3\sigma$ in X rays, $5\sigma$ in gamma rays) in a typical exposure, ranging from a few dozen hours for pointed instruments to 10 years for wide field-of-vew observatories. The MeV gap, highlighted as a gray band, is at the frontier between detection with the photo-electric / Compton effects and pair creation. From {cite}`2022JCAP...08..013L`.
